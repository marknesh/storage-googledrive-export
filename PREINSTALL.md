# Billing

This extension uses other Firebase or Google Cloud Platform services which may have associated charges:

- Cloud Functions
- Cloud Storage
- Google Drive Api

When you use Firebase Extensions, you're only charged for the underlying resources that you use. A paid-tier billing plan is only required if the extension uses a service that requires a paid-tier plan, for example calling to a Google Cloud Platform API or making outbound network requests to non-Google services. All Firebase services offer a free tier of usage. [Learn more about Firebase billing.](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)
