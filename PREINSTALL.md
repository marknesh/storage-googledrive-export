Use this extension to export files from your cloud storage bucket to google drive in real-time.

When a file is uploaded to cloud storage, this extension uploads that file to google drive.

## Important Steps

- Create a folder in Google Drive.

**To allow existing files to be uploaded to Google drive:**

- **Share Editor** access to your folder with the **Extension Service Account Email** when the extension installation is **halfway complete**, in the format `ext-storage-googledrive-export@<YOUR-PROJECT-ID>.iam.gserviceaccount.com` or else you will receive a warning message `Since there is no Google account associated with this email address...`, because the service account will not yet be created.
- This allows existing files to be uploaded to Google Drive immediately after this extension installation is complete, should you choose `yes` for that option.

**To upload new files to Google drive after extension is installed:**

- **Share Editor** access to your folder with the **Extension Service Account Email** when the extension installation is **complete**, in the format `ext-storage-googledrive-export@<YOUR-PROJECT-ID>.iam.gserviceaccount.com` or check [the list of your service accounts](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts).

**Installation of more than one extension instance:**

- If you install more than one instance of this extension, you must also share access to your folder with the new extension instance service account email which can be found [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts).

## Billing

This extension uses other Firebase or Google Cloud Platform services which may have associated charges:

- Cloud Functions
- Cloud Storage
- Google Drive API

When you use Firebase Extensions, you're only charged for the underlying resources that you use. A paid-tier billing plan is only required if the extension uses a service that requires a paid-tier plan, for example calling to a Google Cloud Platform API or making outbound network requests to non-Google services. All Firebase services offer a free tier of usage. [Learn more about Firebase billing.](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)
